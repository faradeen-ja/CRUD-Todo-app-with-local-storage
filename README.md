## The challenge

### The goal is to make a todo app with CRUD mechanism to GET, POST, PUSH and DELETE data live on the user side and be able to store data, this is posible with help of JS functions like formValidation rules by validating the inputed data before submitting,  acceptData by pushing into our local storage with the help of stringify method to get the JSON, > createTasks and mapping that with a call back function to get data from our boostrap modal pop up and resetting form after each submit. For the DELETE I added splice to remove elements from an array and, if necessary, insert new elements in their place,  this will return the deleted element by ID and edit any task with a call back function to each innerHTML elements, on edit it deletes previouse task and retun new data,  then I used Parse to turn JSON into objects to get data from console on to the form.
